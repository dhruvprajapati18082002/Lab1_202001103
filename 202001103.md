Q.1. Identify FRs and NFRs:
The institute has been recently set up to provide state-of-the-art research facilities in the
field of Software Engineering. Apart from research scholars (students) and professors, it also includes quite a large number of employees who work on different projects undertaken by the institution.
As the size and capacity of the institute is increasing with the time, it has been proposed to develop a Library Information System (LIS) for the benefit of students and employees of the institute. LIS will enable the members to borrow a book (or return it) with ease while sitting at his desk/chamber. The system also enables a member to extend the date of his borrowing if no other booking for that particular book has been made. For the library staff, this system aids them to easily handle day-to-day book transactions. The librarian, who has administrative privileges and complete control over the system, can enter a new record into the system when a new book has been purchased, or remove a record in case any book is taken off the shelf. Any non-member is free to use this system to browse/search books online. However, issuing or returning books is restricted to valid users (members) of LIS only. The final deliverable would be a web application (using the recent HTML 5), which should run only within the institute LAN. Although this reduces security risk of the software to a large extent, care should be taken no confidential information (eg., passwords) is stored in plain text.


Ans) 
Functional Requirements:
1)The system should authenticate the users before enabling them to borrow a book.
2)Any non member is free to use the system to browse the books online.
3)Issuing or returning books is only for valid LIS users.
4)The web application should only run within institute LAN.
5)Librarians can enter or delete a record.
6)Authentication of a user before issuing a book .
7)A database log for all issued books .
8)There should be a backup for the database so that incase of any problem, data of the users and books remains.
9)A portal for users to re issue his book and extend the waiting list and fine on his account if the book submitted was past the due date.






Non-Functional Requirements:
1)Concurrency :- Website should be able to handle a number of members at same time
2)Scalability :- The complete system should be scalable as when the number of users increases in future, the system should be able to handle it without any issues.
3)Usability :- The website should be easy to handle and use. It should be easy to navigate.
4)Security :- The system should be able to protect sensitive user and library information
5)Performance :- The throughput and latency of the system should be as low  as possible to increase its performance.
6)Maintenance :- The system should be easy to maintain and update.






Q.2. Identify scope, features and non-functional aspects of the following problem.
Approximately 5% of the world population (or a staggering 466 million people) suffers from disabling hearing loss. We set out to create an impactful solution for this community that addresses some of their everyday needs. Our mobile application uses artificial intelligence to recognize key sound events of interest to this community, such as car horns and babies, where immediate alerts and continual logging are critical for the user. This app is optimized for Android with low-latency so that it works in real-time for use.

Ans)

Scope:
1)The scope of this project is to create a mobile application that addresses the everyday needs of people with disabling hearing loss.
2)The application will use artificial intelligence to recognize key sound events of interest to this community, such as car horns and babies.
3)The app will be optimized for Android devices and will work in real-time with low-latency.

Features:
1)Recognition of key sound events of interest to the hearing-impaired community, such as car horns and babies.
2)Immediate alerts when key sound events are detected.
3)Continual logging of sound events for the user.
4)Optimized for Android devices with low-latency for real-time use.

Non-functional aspects:
1)Performance: The app should have a fast response time and high throughput to ensure that sound events are recognized and logged in real-time.
2)Scalability: The app should be able to handle a large number of users and sound events.
3)Security: The app should protect sensitive user information and ensure that the data is kept private.
4)Usability: The app should be easy to use and navigate for users with disabling hearing loss.
5)Availability: The app should be accessible to users at all times.
6)Maintainability: The app should be easily updated and maintained.
7)Power consumption: The app should minimize the power consumption to prolong battery life.
8)Reliability: The app should be reliable and produce accurate results.
